# Job Preparation
 The repository contains solutions to various coding interview problems extracted from websites like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/neerazz90/), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/b_neerajkumarsi1), [Hackearth](https://www.hackerearth.com/@neerajkumarsingh), [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/dashboard#/), AlgoExpert & [EPI](https://github.com/neerazz/FAANG/blob/master/Algorithms/Resources/Elements%20of%20Programming%20Interviews%20in%20Java.pdf). I've tried to provide the detailed solution and the intution through comments. 
 
 These questions are classical problems that are most frequently asked by the tech giants in technical interviews and are not related to hard core competitive coding.
 `All the code provided inside the repository is purely original and completely my own.`
 
 ### Plan :
 
 - https://www.alimirio.com/posts/read-this-before-you-start-solving-problems-on-leetcode-prep-work
 - https://www.alimirio.com/posts/how-to-solve-problems-on-leetcode-to-prepare-for-technical-interviews
 
 
####  The strategy:

1. Go to a quiet location.

2. Pick a question.

3. Set a timer for 25 minutes.

4. Allocate the first 5 minutes to understand the problem and ask/answer clarifying questions to yourself.

5. Spend the next 20 minutes solving the problem on paper & pen/pencil (until timer rings).

6. Spend the next 10 minutes studying the solution.

7. Stop. Even if you’re in the middle of something important like trying to understand the solution. 

8. Do not spend more than 30–35 minutes per question.

9. Record activity on your progress chart.

10. Revisit the question next week.

### How to contribute? 

1.  Fork the repository
2.  Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
3.  Make a pull request

### When to contribute?

1.  If there is no solution to a problem.
2.  If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.
3.  If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size it would be better to, comment out the original solution and make a pull request with your solution.
