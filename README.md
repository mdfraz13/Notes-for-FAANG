# Job Preparation
 The repository contains solutions to various coding interview problems extracted from websites like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/neerazz90/), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/b_neerajkumarsi1), [Hackearth](https://www.hackerearth.com/@neerajkumarsingh), [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/dashboard#/), AlgoExpert & [EPI](https://github.com/neerazz/FAANG/blob/master/Algorithms/Resources/Elements%20of%20Programming%20Interviews%20in%20Java.pdf). I've tried to provide the detailed solution and the intution through comments. 
 
 These questions are classical problems that are most frequently asked by the tech giants in technical interviews and are not related to hard core competitive coding.
 `All the code provided inside the repository is purely original and completely my own.`
